Well, if you haven’t noticed (you may want to make an appointment with your eye doctor if you didn’t notice), I changed the theme of the blog. I feel that it is a good summer-y theme (also pirate-y! in celeberation of Pirates of the Carribean 2, which I’m seeing tonight, by the way), with the whole sand background and such. Regardless, the new theme means some changes, aside from the obvious visual changes. The comments section of every post now looks pretty terrible, with all of those brown stars. Well, those brown stars happen to be the default avatar for this theme. And, considering none of us have avatars, we all have the default. So it naturally looks pretty ugly.

**UPDATE (07-07-06):** _I have since un-ugly-ified the comments section by manually removing the default avatar and generally cleaning it up. I love this theme, but that section was poorly done. That’s probably why it couldn’t win the WordPress Theme Contest. ANYWAY, I still would like people to get avatars, just because it is so much cooler when you have a picture represent you. Don’t you agree?_ 

So what am I going to do about this ugliness? Simple! I am going to make you pay to change it. All you have to do is Register for this blog (click [here](http://eatyourexam.com/wp-register.php) to do that). It only costs…

It’s actually _**free**_. So, what are you waiting for? Register, then make yourself or find yourself a cool avatar. Then start posting comments so the comments sections can be populated with cool avatars. See the logic? Good. So register and then be happy when stuff becomes un-ugly.
