Just so everyone knows, the previous entry (Sony Cancels PS3!) was just an April Fool&#8217;s joke. I thought it was pretty obvious, but I guess if you don&#8217;t have Firefox then the pop-up window I did in Javascript would look pretty real (Firefox adds the site URL it came from, which would say http://eatyourexam.com before the title of the window. This is to prevent people who actually spoof for bad purposes, like Paypal phishers). Regardless, I just wanted to clear that up so no one actually goes on with life thinking that the PS3 is no more. (especially all you XBOX fan boys)
