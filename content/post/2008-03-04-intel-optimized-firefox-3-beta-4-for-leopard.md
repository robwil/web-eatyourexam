Mozilla Developers moved the Mozilla HEAD branch from Beta 3 to Beta 4 at the end of January. I decided that I should make a new build since this name change must mean there have been some big improvements. Also, I was having problems with the old build I posted on the site. The reason I am only posting this build now (over a month after building it) is because I was having issues with the installer generator script included with Mozilla. I still haven&#8217;t figured it out, so for that reason I have simply zipped the Minefield.app directory. So, to install, simply unzip and drag the app to your /Applications/ folder. Anyway, I have been using this build for a long time and it includes the awesome new look that Firefox 3 stable will feature&#8230; it looks very Safari-like for the Mac version. I just love the new look. I know there&#8217;s been tons of development since I built this version, but this is the first Beta build I have made that works 100%. It has never crashed on me yet, and it works fast and looks good while doing it. The bookmark system works entirely as well, whereas the Beta 2 build was kind of messed up. I highly recommend this version even for production environments.
