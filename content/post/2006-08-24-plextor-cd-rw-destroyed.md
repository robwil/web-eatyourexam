I read an [here](http://www.freedesktop.org/~davidr/xgl-demo1.xvid.avi) (AVI download). It&#8217;s got amazing effects, sort of like Mac OSX Leopard and Vista combined, and then with added twists (and I mean twists literally, haha). I had to give it a try. I currently had Ubuntu installed on my test machine, but only the server version (which didn&#8217;t include the GUI). It was also severely broken after I combined testing and stable packages into the same repository&#8230; not a good idea. I had to re-install. Unfortunately, my CD drive wasn&#8217;t working to well. It barely worked. In fact, I had to eject the drive tray just to let the computer boot. And by the time the system was up, the drive&#8217;s tray would forget how to go back in, so I had to manually push it in (the gears wouldn&#8217;t finish the job as usual when you pushed it in). That being said, yesterday it actually did work&#8230; or at least I thought.

I got to the install screen, and even started installing. Unfortunately, at 72% of the way through installing it,Â  it froze because the CD-ROM drive refused to continue reading. What a bummer. Luckily, I had Debian 3.1 (Sarge) installed on the same machine already. I used that, and did a dist-upgrade to Debian Etch (Testing), which let me try out XGL/Compiz. It was very fun, but had some bugs. I wanted the full experience, so I would need to install Ubuntu Dapper Drake some way and follow the above guide. My first impression was to spend a whole day hacking a PXE network install of Ubuntu, but then I remembered I still have my old CD-ROM drive lying around (that was replaced by the Plextor CD-RW that was currently in the machine). So, I would kill two birds with one stone&#8230; put in a working drive capable of installing Ubuntu without any hacks or confusion, and I would also rid myself of the annoyance of remembering to eject the CD drive every time I boot the computer.

Then the idea hit me. Why would I content myself with simply replacing the drive and throwing the Plextor in the garbage? It didn&#8217;t even deserve to be in a dumpster&#8230; it needed to be _**DESTROYED**_. So, that is what I did. I dropped it off my sun roof (three stories up), but after that yielded disappointing results I smashed it with a hammer until it was in a million little pieces. Check out the photos of the whole thing right [](http://www.eatyourexam.com/photos/thumbnails.php?album=4).
