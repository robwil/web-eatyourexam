title: Thank You Bluehost

I believe I mentioned this in my first post onto this blog, but I use Bluehost.com as my hosting provider. They provided me with my domain name, as well as the exorbitant amount of space and bandwidth. Well, they are working their magic and providing _even more_ to their users, free of charge. The newly upgraded version has 15GB (up from 10GB) of storage space, and &#8211; this is the real biggie &#8211; 450GB of bandwidth per month! That is an absolutely insane amount, and I can&#8217;t imagine ever using that. But at least now I can rest assured that I will never run out, even if the site continues to grow. I just wanted to take the time to publicly thank Bluehost for the 100% uptime ( \*knock on wood\* ) in these past months, and the continual improvement of their offered services.
