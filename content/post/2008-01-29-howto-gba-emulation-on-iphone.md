I&#8217;m not going to reinvent the wheel here by making my own tutorial. Great ones already exist.

Check out this site for a nice tutorial on GBA emulation on the iPhone (thanks to the gpsPhone program):

This tutorial has some spots where it says to upload files via SSH. You can learn how to do that by following this tutorial on the same site:

Overall, that entire site is great for iPhone/iPod Touch beginners.
