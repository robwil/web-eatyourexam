I added a phpBB forum to the site, just for the heck of it. You can access it by clicking on the appropriately named &#8220;Forum&#8221; link on the side bar. People have been using the comment section of the blog to ask me questions, etc., mainly because that was the only place they could write stuff. Well, now I added the forum, so that is where questions should be posted. I&#8217;m going to try to keep the comments as&#8230; comments. Any tech questions or general things should be on the forum.

I am also contemplating a wiki for the site, but those are most effective with a lot of users who don&#8217;t mind writing content. What the topic of the wiki will be, I don&#8217;t know, but I am waiting for more users before I even think about that. One idea that may be cool is a Product Review wiki, that would be in the style of consumer reports. You could post your own pages about various products you have tried, your experience with it, and so on. That is just a brainstorming idea for now, but it could work if enough people felt like writing about their product experience.

As you can see, I have big plans for this site. Too big, perhaps. But maybe it can become a useful site, as opposed to just a place for me personally to translate thoughts into words.
