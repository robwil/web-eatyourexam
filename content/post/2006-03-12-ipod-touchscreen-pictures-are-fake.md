title: iPod Touchscreen Pictures are Fake!
url: /?p=29
---
A lot of people seem to think the recent &#8216;new&#8217; iPod Video (with touchscreen) pictures on the internet are real. Yes, it is true&#8230; Apple did file for a patent for touchscreen media devices, but that is about the only fact surrounding this issue. There are a lot of variants in the pictures, from a [gallery](http://guides.macrumors.com/Gallery_of_Video_iPod_Mockups) of all of the mock-ups as of now, and not a single one is confirmed true.

The creators of many of these images have admitted their con, and some have actually given examples of how they made the fakes. One made a [screen capture](http://img234.imageshack.us/my.php?image=proof0te.jpg) of his computer&#8217;s desktop, showing him modifying the image in Photoshop.

I personally find all this Photoshop hysteria amusing. The greatest part is how serious some rumor sites take this. There are many people that were fooled by this, and it just further proves the saying: _&#8220;Believe nothing of what you hear, and only half of what you see.&#8221;_ In today&#8217;s world of talented Photoshop users, you probably shouldn&#8217;t believe anything of what you see on the Internet. In conclusion, the pictures are all fake. Just hold your breath until April 1 when Apple will officially announce their new iPod. But considering the announcement is going to be on April Fool&#8217;s Day, I would even regard that with a healthy sense of skepticism.
