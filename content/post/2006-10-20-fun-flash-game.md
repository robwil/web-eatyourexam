Check out <a target="_blank" title="Awesome Flash Game" href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/40255643/">this awesome Flash game</a>. Basically, you use a pencil tool to draw lines. Then a sledding guy uses those lines as his path. At first it is odd because you are getting used to the physics, but you can quickly do awesome stunts with it. My favorite thing to do is make a really steep slope so he builds up major speed, then have him go off a ramp into a wall! I tried to do a flip but still haven&#8217;t been able to get him to land well. 🙁 Let me know what things you can do.
