It is official: Sony has delayed the PS3. OK, actually this was official yesterday. I’m a bit behind. I got a little too into Guild Wars last night. Anyway, you already know how I feel about PS3, so I’ll be brief.

Variety Magazine [interviewed](http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117939258?categoryid=18&cs=1&s=h&p=0 "Variety Magazine Interviews Sony CEO") the new CEO of Sony, Howard Stringer, who they call the “Traveling man”. He’s the first non-Japanese CEO of Sony since the company’s conception, and he is claiming that he will take the entire company to new heights. In fact, he’s British and has no formal CEO experience, but he’s level-headed and Sony thinks he is right for the job. He has much plans for the company in the coming years, which he discussed in the interview. And as you know, Sony cannot describe their roadmap for the future without mentioning Playstation and Blu-Ray.

The following is the snippet about PS3.

>  <span class="postbody">Sony’s new PlayStation 3 was widely expected to be introduced this spring, but will be delayed as the company fine-tunes the chips that are crucial to the success of the console’s Blu-ray function. The PlayStation 3 — which is being called “the poor man’s Blue-ray” — is vital to Sony’s plans because it plays Blu-ray discs as well as videogames.</span>
> 
> Sony will roll out the PS3 by year end, in time for the holidays. If PS3 “delivers what everyone thinks it will, the game is up,” Stringer boasts.
> 
> Blu-ray is the system developed by Sony to view next-generation high-definition DVDs. Rival format HD DVD is championed by Toshiba. Microsoft recently joined the HD DVD camp, a move that came as its Xbox 360 videogame console is trying to grab market share from PlayStation, the industry leader.

The only scary thing I see here is that Stringer is only officially talking about the Japanese release. Sony claims to want to release the system in Europe, Japan, and America very close to each other, but I don’t know if I can believe that. If Japan’s release is Fall 06, an American release may very well be early 07. At least now we have an official report that Spring 06 is not happening, something that I sort of figured anyway.
