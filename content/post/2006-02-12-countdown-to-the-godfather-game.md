EDIT (03-03-06): Countdown applet removed because it slowed down the page&#8217;s load time.

This game is going to be incredible. It is said to be the most expensive video game ever created. EA is truly going all out to provide a HUGE open ended world. Think GTA, except with the Godfather&#8217;s expert story telling. You get to play a member of the Corleone family! How much better can you possibly get? The game is supposedly going to allow the player to choose how they want to play: intimidate or negotiate. I think we all know what we&#8217;re going to do, and let&#8217;s just say it doesn&#8217;t start with an &#8220;n&#8221;. The above countdown displays, down to the second, how much time remains before gamers everywhere can beat up bakers who forgot to pay for &#8220;protection&#8221;.
