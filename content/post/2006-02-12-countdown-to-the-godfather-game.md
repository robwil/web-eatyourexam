EDIT (03-03-06): Countdown applet removed because it slowed down the page’s load time.

This game is going to be incredible. It is said to be the most expensive video game ever created. EA is truly going all out to provide a HUGE open ended world. Think GTA, except with the Godfather’s expert story telling. You get to play a member of the Corleone family! How much better can you possibly get? The game is supposedly going to allow the player to choose how they want to play: intimidate or negotiate. I think we all know what we’re going to do, and let’s just say it doesn’t start with an “n”. The above countdown displays, down to the second, how much time remains before gamers everywhere can beat up bakers who forgot to pay for “protection”.
