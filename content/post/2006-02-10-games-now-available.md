I plan on downloading the flash (.SWF) files from various game sites and hosting them here. My web host supports both Flash and Shockwave, so it will definitely work. I have already uploaded all three Mini Putt games and Mini Pool 2D, a similar game but with a pool environment instead of golf. As always, you can access it via the side bar, this time with the link “Flash Games”.

Anyway, I don’t really feel like putting _every_ game I can find on here, so I will instead just make a topic on the forum regarding it. If you would like to see a game hosted on this site, just post the link to it in the appropriate forum topic.
