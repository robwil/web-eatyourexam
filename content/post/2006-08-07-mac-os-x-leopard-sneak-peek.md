Words cannot even describe this. Just do yourself a favor and go on over to the Mac OS X Leopard preview over on <a target="_blank" title="Apple Mac OS X Leopard: Sneak Peek" href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/index.html">Apple.com</a>. The new features are amazing. In particular, check out the videos for Time Machine, Spaces, and iChat. Unbelievable! Then go on over to CNET and look at the <a target="_blank" title="Windows Vista Beta 2 Preview" href="http://reviews.cnet.com/4660-3513_7-6530547.html">Vista Beta 2 preview</a>. Tell me which one you think is better! I&#8217;ve got two words for Microsoft: watch out. As for me, you know where I&#8217;ll be Spring 2007 (at an Apple store!).
