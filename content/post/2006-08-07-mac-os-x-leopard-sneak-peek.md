Words cannot even describe this. Just do yourself a favor and go on over to the Mac OS X Leopard preview over on [Vista Beta 2 preview](http://reviews.cnet.com/4660-3513_7-6530547.html). Tell me which one you think is better! I’ve got two words for Microsoft: watch out. As for me, you know where I’ll be Spring 2007 (at an Apple store!).
