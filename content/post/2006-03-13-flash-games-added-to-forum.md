By using the <a target="_blank" title="PhpBB Activity Mod" href="http://www.phpbb-amod.co.uk/kb.php">Arcade Mod</a> in combination with the forum (phpbb), I was able to accomplish my goal: to allow tracking of high scores. Unfortunately, it is a lot more difficult than I had originally imagined. Installing the mod was easy, and using it is even easier. However, just using any Flash game doesn&#8217;t work. You have to get a game built specifically for the mod, or else the score post feature won&#8217;t work. Considering that was the only reason I did this, why would I settle for it not working? I dug around the knowledge base of their site, and it seems you can modify any Flash game to work. Unfortunately, this process takes some time, and is pretty complex. You have to actually &#8220;decompile&#8221; the SWF file of the game you wish to modify, then add your own button, complete with the code to submit the score. It&#8217;s a lot more difficult than I would have liked, but it isn&#8217;t bad. Over the next few days I am going to be converting the games already featured on the site to Arcade Mod-friendly format. From this point forward, I&#8217;m not going to update eatyourexam.com/games, but instead focus on the Games section of the Forum. So, if you don&#8217;t have an account yet and you play the games, now would be the time to register!

Also notable is the fact that for each and every theme on the forum, I have to modify some files to get the games working. That is why it is using the default silver theme right now. I just got Solaris and subBlack working, but they don&#8217;t look as good as the default, since that is what the images are meant for. Depending on if I feel like adding more themes, I may make it so there is a larger selection to choose from. But&#8230; I&#8217;m not going to get carried away. We&#8217;ll see what happens.
