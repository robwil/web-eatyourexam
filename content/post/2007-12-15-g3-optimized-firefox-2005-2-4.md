Mozilla Developers have recently moved the Mozilla HEAD branch from Beta 2 to Beta 3. I decided that I should make a new build since this name change must mean there have been some big improvements. Also, after upgrading to the latest Quicktime version my Firefox build (the old Beta 2 one) has become really slow. Anyway, here is Mozilla Firefox 3.0 Beta 3 optimized for Intel! Click [here](http://eatyourexam.com/my-files/ff-opt/firefox-3.0b3pre.en-US.mac.dmg "Intel-Optimized Firefox 3.0 Beta 3 Download") to download it.
