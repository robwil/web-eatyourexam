I saw this video on YouTube and just had to link to it. It is freakish, to say the least. If this is actually a real video, I feel sorry for the guy in it. You will undoubtedly want to watch this over and over again, because it is just so disgusting and so unbelievable. <a target="_blank" title="Eye-Popping Video" href="http://www.eatyourexam.com/my-videos/eye_popping.htm">Click here</a> to see it (hosted locally).
