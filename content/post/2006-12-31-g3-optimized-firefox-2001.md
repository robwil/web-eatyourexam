After realizing that <a target="_blank" title="Comments to previous Firefox G3-optimized build" href="http://eatyourexam.com/?p=66#comment-7823">some people</a> actually make use of my G3-optimized Firefox builds (other than me), I decided to make a habit out of releasing a build for each Firefox release. I am posting this entry from my newly built Firefox 2.0.0.1 optimized for G3. This time, since I simply updated the source tree and recompiled as opposed to compiled from scratch, it only took about two hours and forty-five minutes, as opposed to five hours. Dedicating about three hours to create these builds with every Firefox release isn&#8217;t a big deal at all, especially if people make use of them.

You can download the new 2.0.0.1 build by clicking <a target="_blank" title="Firefox G3-Optimized 2.0.0.1 Download" href="http://eatyourexam.com/my-files/ff-opt/firefox-2.0.0.1.en-US.mac.dmg">here</a>.
