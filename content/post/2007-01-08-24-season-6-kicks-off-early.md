For those of you who like the Fox TV show, 24, as much as I do, I have some very nice news… the new season is starting a little early for those of you with a Bittorrent client. While I won’t post any links for legal reasons, the 4-hour premiere for the sixth season that is set to hit the States on Sunday and Monday (the 14th and 15th respectively) has already hit the torrent community. Though I have no idea where the leak came from, these first four hours were released yesterday. Having “previewed” them myself, I can confirm the validity of the various other sources that report on the leak.
