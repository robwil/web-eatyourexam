title: Spam Explosion!

Almost every blog out there today suffered a huge [spam explosion](http://news.com.com/2100-7349_3-6059672.html?part=rss&tag=6059672&subj=news), including this one. You may or may not have noticed it, but the ‘comment spam’ (spam left in the comments section of posts) was quite explicit. I managed to delete all 100+ messages, but that is only a temporary solution. Therefore, I am now requiring approval for every comment user. So, if you go to post a comment now, I will have to approve it. However, after I approve one comment all subsequent comments under the same name won’t need to be reapproved. This should keep the spammers at bay temporarily, while I tweak the filters.
