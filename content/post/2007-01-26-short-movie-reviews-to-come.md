title: Short Movie Reviews to Come

One of my many New Year’s resolutions this year is to watch one movie per week (the way I figure… the more resolutions you make the more likely at least one will be fulfilled, but I can see how that is failing logic). So far, I have met that goal. The movies that I have been watching are not your typical action, horror, or suspense flick, but actually very intellectual dramas (like Amores Perros and 21 Grams). What I thought that I would do is every week when I watch a movie, I would make a small write-up/review about it. I don’t want it to be as long as the [Silent Hill movie review](http://eatyourexam.com/?p=42) I did a while back, but it will rather be maybe 1-3 paragraphs discussing how I felt about the movie as a whole and the actors in it. It is going to be a thematic type discussion, and will hopefully be vague enough on plot details to not spoil anything.

I’m not promising anything, but I am going to watch the following movies some time soon and may make write-ups about them: Casino Royale, The Descent, Miami Vice, The Prestige, The Good Shepherd, and The 25th Hour (not modern).
