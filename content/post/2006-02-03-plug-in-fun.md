I figured I would add another plug-in today. This one shows the top 3 commentators on the side bar under all of the links. Not all that complex or anything, but cool nonetheless.

Also notable is the fact that I am looking for a spell check plug-in for those of you that are concerned with that sort of thing. There are many out there, but the problem is that none of them work well with WordPress 2.0, the version that I use. Most only work with 1.2 or 1.5. So, eventually that will be implemented.

I am also looking at a weather plug-in, and also one that can show a countdown to particular events. Both already exist, but I will hold off on adding them because I think they might make the sidebar seem bloated. Iâ€™m trying to keep everything as simple and elegant as possible.
