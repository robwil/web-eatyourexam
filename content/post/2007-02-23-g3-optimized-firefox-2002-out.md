title: G3-Optimized Firefox 2.0.0.2 Out!

I am proud to release my first 0-day G3-optimized build. Firefox 2.0.0.2 was <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0.0.2/releasenotes/#whatsnew" target="_blank" title="Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.2 Release Notes: What's New">released by Mozilla</a> to fix some security issues to their FTP servers this morning. My auto-update on Windows didn&#8217;t recognize it until about 6 p.m. which is when I assume they put it up on the main site at getfirefox.com. Regardless, the G3-optimized build is now available exclusively here on eatyourexam.com for download. Enjoy.

Download the new build by clicking <a href="http://eatyourexam.com/my-files/ff-opt/firefox-2.0.0.2.en-US.mac.dmg" target="_blank" title="Firefox 2.0.0.2 Optimized for G3: Download">here</a>.
