title: G3-Optimized Firefox 2.0.0.2 Out!

I am proud to release my first 0-day G3-optimized build. Firefox 2.0.0.2 was [released by Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0.0.2/releasenotes/#whatsnew) to fix some security issues to their FTP servers this morning. My auto-update on Windows didn&#8217;t recognize it until about 6 p.m. which is when I assume they put it up on the main site at getfirefox.com. Regardless, the G3-optimized build is now available exclusively here on eatyourexam.com for download. Enjoy.

Download the new build by clicking [here](http://eatyourexam.com/my-files/ff-opt/firefox-2.0.0.2.en-US.mac.dmg).
