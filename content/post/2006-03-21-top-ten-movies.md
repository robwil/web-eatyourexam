The following is a very rough draft. I&#8217;m still reviewing a couple of movies that may possibly make it to this list, and the order is still very temporary. As far as trilogies (or sagas, in the case of Star Wars), I listed my favorite one, much like my [Top Ten Video Games](http://eatyourexam.com/?p=17), in parentheses. In these cases, I highly enjoyed the entire series (or felt that the series as a whole represented masterful film-making, while any one alone wasn&#8217;t particularly special), but just listed my favorite one. In other trilogies where I just loved one movie out of them, I will just list that movie without any parentheses, like in the case of Godfather.

  1. V For Vendetta
  2. Adaptation
  3. Pan&#8217;s Labyrinth
  4. The Matrix (Reloaded)
  5. Butterfly Effect
  6. 21 Grams
  7. Mulholland Drive
  8. Lord of the Rings (Return of the King)
  9. Godfather: Part I
 10. Swordfish

EDIT 08-26-07: I made some more modifications, adding a few new movies and also removing some. I really want to only focus on movies that I feel really matter in the grand scheme of things: where the movie transcended the screen and tugged at my very existence.
