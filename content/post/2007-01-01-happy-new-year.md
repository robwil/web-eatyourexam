I just wanted to wish everyone a Happy New Year. 2006 was a relatively good year for this site. I hope it is just the beginning. I can’t say I am disappointed that almost all my traffic is due to the games on the forum, but I would like to broaden my horizons, so to speak. I’m hoping to put up at least two meaningful articles per month. I was really losing that the end of last year. Here’s to a 2007 filled with much more traffic and diversity in content.
