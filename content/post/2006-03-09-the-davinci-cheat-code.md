I read this article last Friday and was extremely amused by it. I figured I would post a link here for everyone else’s entertainment. It is surprisingly pretty long, but every second of it is very funny. For example, the following is a quote that shows the ‘tongue-in-cheek’ mentality of the article:

> “The Catholic Church!” he exclaimed. “There are truths that the church doesn’t want anyone to know. That’s why there was an Xbox 360 shortage.”
> 
> “You lost me.”
> 
> We ducked back into the garage. “The 360 supply shortages [are caused by delays in the manufacture of RAM chips](http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/2006/02/memory_chips_ar.html) from a German corporation, appropriately named Infineon Technologies. Through holding companies, the Vatican owns 67% of Infineon stock. They’ll stop at nothing to keep that console off the market. But the cover-up’s been going on for centuries.”

Now you have an idea of how ridiculous the ‘story’ is. The whole article in its entirety is more funny than any one part, so I recommend you have a read. So, without further ado, I present Fargo’s [The DaVinci Cheat Code](http://www.gamespy.com/articles/693/693211p4.html).
