I read this article last Friday and was extremely amused by it. I figured I would post a link here for everyone else&#8217;s entertainment. It is surprisingly pretty long, but every second of it is very funny. For example, the following is a quote that shows the &#8216;tongue-in-cheek&#8217; mentality of the article:

> &#8220;The Catholic Church!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;There are truths that the church doesn&#8217;t want anyone to know. That&#8217;s why there was an Xbox 360 shortage.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;You lost me.&#8221;
> 
> We ducked back into the garage. &#8220;The 360 supply shortages [are caused by delays in the manufacture of RAM chips](http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/2006/02/memory_chips_ar.html) from a German corporation, appropriately named Infineon Technologies. Through holding companies, the Vatican owns 67% of Infineon stock. They&#8217;ll stop at nothing to keep that console off the market. But the cover-up&#8217;s been going on for centuries.&#8221;

Now you have an idea of how ridiculous the &#8216;story&#8217; is. The whole article in its entirety is more funny than any one part, so I recommend you have a read. So, without further ado, I present Fargo&#8217;s [The DaVinci Cheat Code](http://www.gamespy.com/articles/693/693211p4.html).
