title: Top Ten Games
url: /?p=17

I have decided to, if only for my own referential purposes, compile a list of what I believe to be the best ten games ever created. The order is extremely temporary, as I find it hard to compare games that I have played years apart from each other. For example, I can hardly remember the feeling that I got when playing Goldeneye 007 five or six years ago. And donâ€™t even get me started with Super Nintendo and earlier; my memory just isnâ€™t all that great.

The worst part of this whole list is that when I am playing a game I usually feel like it is incredible, even if it is only great. I guess the immersion into the game creates a superficial perfection. I thought Call of Duty 2 was one of the best PC games Iâ€™ve ever played while I was into it, but in retrospect I just canâ€™t rank it alongside these games. It doesnâ€™t even come close to Half-Life 2 (which isnâ€™t even included) in terms of story or depth, and so I just canâ€™t waste a valuable spot on it.

I would describe why I like each game, but for the sake of brevity I will not (at least not in this post). Furthermore, I just canâ€™t explain why I like some of these games enough to put them in my top ten.

One final note is one about franchises. For example, Final Fantasy has about six or seven games that I really love. I only chose to list my favorite one here. If I were actually to count each one separately and rank them, the series would occupy about a third of this list. For that reason, I left out the other two that I really liked, but did list them next to the one that I consider my favorite, considering them honorable mentions. You will see what I mean when you read the below list. So, without further ado, here are the TOP TEN GAMES OF ALL TIME, in my opinion:

  1. Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (honorable mention: Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater)
  2. Final Fantasy IX (honorable mention: Final Fantasy X-2, Final Fantasy VII)
  3. Baldur’s Gate 2: Shadows of Amn
  4. Xenosaga Episode III (Honorable Mention: Xenosaga Episode I)
  5. Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines
  6. Perfect Dark (honorable mention: Goldeneye 007)
  7. Suikoden III
  8. Madden NFL 07 (all of them are great, but I just went with the latest and greatest)
  9. Resident Evil IV
 10. Freedom Fighters

Expect copious edits to follow this initial release as I finish more games. I suppose I shall consider this version 1.0 of the list. _EDIT (11-23-06): Some changes were made._
